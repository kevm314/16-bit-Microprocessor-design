# 16-bit-Microprocessor-design
This project involved the design of a 16 bit microprocessor in VHDL with a fully working working control unit, program counter, 0.512 kB Random Access Memory (RAM), 8 general purpose registers, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and a functional datapath.

The repository contains a document titled "Microprocessor Project Summary" which is a PDF report summarising all of the VHDL module files in the repository.
